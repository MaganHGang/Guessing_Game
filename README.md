# Guessing_Game
First project in java used to get used to github- you have to guess the computer's number

To run jar file in command line navigate to dist folder of this project & type "java - jar GuessMagan". Enjoy my game it's not that perfect lol

Note: Make sure you're running this in the latest java version just in case my GUI dialog boxes don't pop up.
